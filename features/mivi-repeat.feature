Feature: Undo
  In order to edit text quickly
  As a user
  I want to repeat previous command

  Scenario: repeat delete
    Given the buffer is empty
    When I insert:
    """
    foo
    bar baz
    """
    And I go to beginning of buffer
    And I type "dw"
    Then I should see pattern "^$"
    When I go to line "2"
    And I type "."
    Then I should see pattern "^baz$"
